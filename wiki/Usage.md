# Usage

Run `help` inside Terminal Rust for the authoritative command list.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pwd` | Print the working directory |
| `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `rm` | Portable file operations |
| `clear` | Clear an ANSI-capable terminal |
| `dashboard` | Open the live system and project dashboard |
| `git status\|branch\|log` | Run an allowlisted read-only Git operation |
| `theme list`, `theme preview` | Inspect built-in prompt themes |
| `plugins list` | Inspect plugin manifests and permissions |
| `commands list` | Inspect configured user commands |
| `exit`, `quit` | Close the session |

The dashboard refreshes once per second. Press `q`, `Escape` or `Ctrl+C` to
leave it. Redirected output and limited terminals receive a stable text
snapshot.

`Tab` and `Shift+Tab` cycle completions. Accept a dim history suggestion with
`Right Arrow` and hide it with `Left Arrow`.

Desktop sessions are isolated per tab. Use `Ctrl/Command+T` to create a tab,
`Ctrl/Command+W` to close it, `Ctrl+Tab` to switch tabs and `Ctrl/Command+,` to
open settings.
